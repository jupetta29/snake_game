# Snake Game
> This project is a recreation of the best game from the classic Nokia 3310

Snake Game is a game where the player maneuvers the head of a snake. 
The player earns points by maneuvering the snake into food and feeding it. 
Each time the snake eats, the snake gets longer. 
The player's goal is to gain as many points as possible while keeping the snake from colliding with the walls and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.
